Full-stack Node.js / ReactJS app.

Purpose of app is to scrape several websites using cheerio to collect stats on baseball players.  These stats are used to calculate BPO+ which is inspired by this website and accompanying book: http://www.bestworstbaseball.com/statistics.html

App makes use of several new technologies for me:
- DynamoDB (used local for development before pushing to web service)
- ReactJS (for front-end)

Later versions will include:
- Implementation of Flux architecture in ReactJS front-end
- Addition of Google Analytics
- AWS Lambda with AWS API Service
- CI/CD pipeline

Thanks for checking out my project!!
